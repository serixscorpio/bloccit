# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web
developemnt skills.

Production url at: http://eric-bloccit.herokuapp.com

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your
application should contain your sensitive credentials.  It should be included
in .gitignore as well.

Made with my mentor, Joost Baaij at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)
